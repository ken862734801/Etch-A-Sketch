# Summary

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to use utilize javascript and DOM manipulation to produce the browser equivalent of an etch-a-sketch. 
[Link to the assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

I plan to revist the project and fix some bugs regarding the creation of a new grid, as well, as attempt to make it more clear which mode the program is in but for now I am happy with the result.

## Features
-Basic touch screen functionality. Gives user ability to draw on mobile devices.
-Color input gives user access to color palette.
-Rainbow function produces a randomly generated color for each "pixel" drawn over.
-Range input gives user ability to change "pixel" size. 

# Resources

Stackoverflow and google were my best friends for this project. Initially I wasn't planning on implementing mobile utility; however, coming across one of the past solutions to the assignment, which I will link below, inspired me. I was familiar with the basic events that can be listened for with javascript, but had never tought about touch events, and in the case of this assignment, the touchmove event.
